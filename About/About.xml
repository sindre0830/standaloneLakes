A simple mod that adds buildable lakes to the game.

This is a standalone mod from my series Natural. If you want to check out my other mod, Natural Paths, id suggest you subscribe to Natural Lakes as an addon.

Stats
  - Cost: Nothing
  - Work to build: 256

  - Beauty: 2

README: The only way to remove the lake after it has been built is by placing a moisture pump, just like the shallow water in vanilla.
